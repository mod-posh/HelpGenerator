# ADR-005 — Schema validation and offline strategy

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-20

## Context

We must “understand the schema” and guarantee validity. Online schemas may move; offline builds must still work.

### Decision

* We implement schema validation as a first-class feature:

  * `Test-HelpInfoXml` validates HelpInfo.xml against schema + semantic rules.
  * `Test-MamlHelp` validates MAML structure (schema where practical + semantic rules).
* Schema retrieval:

  * Provide a cmdlet to **fetch/update schema bundles** into a local cache folder (repo or user profile)
  * Tool defaults to **offline cached schemas**; online update is explicit.

### Consequences

* Deterministic builds in CI.
* Reduced risk of schema drift breaking releases.
