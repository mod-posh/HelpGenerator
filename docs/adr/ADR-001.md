# ADR-001 — Scope and non-goals

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-20

## Context

We are building a suite to generate PowerShell help assets quickly and consistently. The suite must support both script-based help sources and compiled cmdlets.

### Decision

This project **only** does:

1. Parse **comment-based help** from PowerShell scripts/modules and generate:

   * **MAML external help** (command help content)
   * **HelpInfo.xml** (updatable help metadata)
2. If comment-based help is missing, generate **placeholder scaffolds** (script help blocks and/or markdown placeholders).
3. Parse **HelpInfo.xml** and **MAML** and generate **discrete Markdown documentation**.
4. Validate generated artifacts against **official schemas** (HelpInfo schema + MAML schema where applicable).
5. Support **updatable help** distribution structure (CAB packaging layout + expected metadata).

### Non-goals

Explicitly out of scope:

* General documentation tooling unrelated to PowerShell help
* Website generation / doc hosting / static site generation
* API documentation generation for arbitrary languages/frameworks
* PlatyPS integration, extension, or consumption
* Arbitrary markdown “beautification” beyond help-document clarity

### Consequences

* Feature proposals must directly serve *help artifacts* (comment help ↔ MAML/HelpInfo ↔ markdown ↔ CAB/updateable layout).
* Anything that doesn’t shorten “time to correct help” is rejected.
